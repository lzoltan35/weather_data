Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA - Third Homework - Weather Data

This repository contains the `weather_data.csv`, which is contains the weather information that I used for training the Mean Temperature predicting neural networks.


I have created a weather database for the training based on the archived weather data on [this website](http://idojarasbudapest.hu/archivalt-idojaras). (I also used [an other website](https://www.metnet.hu/?m=napi-adatok) to fill the occasionally missing data).
