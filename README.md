Deep Learning in Practice with Python and LUA - Third Homework - Weather Data

This repository contains the `weather_data.csv`, which is contains the weather information that I used for training the Mean Temperature predicting neural networks.


created a weather database for the training based on the archived weather data on [this website](http://idojarasbudapest.hu/archivalt-idojaras). (I also used [an other website](https://www.metnet.hu/?m=napi-adatok) to fill the occasionally missing data).

**Important note:** The weather data for the last day (October 29th) might be inaccurate, because at the time I got the data for it, the day was not over yet (so the `Minimum Temperature`, therefore the `Mean Temperature` as well might be off).
